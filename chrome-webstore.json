Using either the extension icon in the toolbar or one of the link dropdown buttons added to the github.com UI, a popup is shown with a list of convenient formats for the current page. Clicking any of the links will copy a link in that format to your clipboard.\n\nThe link is copied using the full URL of the current page and the text of the format selected. Links are copied in both plain text format (just the text, without the URL) and as a hyperlink to the current page's full URL.",
