Using either the extension icon in the toolbar or one of the link dropdown buttons added to the github.com UI, a popup is shown with a list of convenient formats for the current page. Clicking any of the links will copy a link in that format to your clipboard. Links are copied in both plain text format (just the text, without the URL) and as a hyperlink to the current page's full URL for compatibility pasting into any application.",
