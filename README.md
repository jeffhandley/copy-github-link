# Chromium Extension: Copy GitHub Link

Copy a formatted GitHub link to a repository, issue, or pull request.

## Acknowledgements

This extension was originally inspired by @zaki-yama, and their [zaki-yama/copy-title-and-url-as-markdown: Chrome Extension: Quickly copy the title & url of current tab as Markdown style](https://github.com/zaki-yama/copy-title-and-url-as-markdown). Fun note, that extension was used to copy that link as Markdown.

Additional acknowledgement to @timheuer for creating [timheuer/repolink](https://github.com/timheuer/repolink) when I asked if an extension like this existed. Tim's quick turnaround for creating that extension encouraged the development of this implementation.
