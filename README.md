## Acknowledgements

This extension's implementation is based on similar work by @zaki-yama, and their [zaki-yama/copy-title-and-url-as-markdown: Chrome Extension: Quickly copy the title & url of current tab as Markdown style](https://github.com/zaki-yama/copy-title-and-url-as-markdown). Fun note, that extension was used to copy that link as Markdown.
